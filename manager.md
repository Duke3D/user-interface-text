### Why do we have Manager?

This dates back over 10 years to Mambo. Do we need it? Doesn't it just complicate things?

####Consistency
Whatever we do we must be consistent. Some menus say manager eg articles and some do not eg contacts

From what I can tell the logic is
Component Name: View Name

#####using com_users as an example
User Manager: Users           ?option=com_users&view=users   
User Manager: User Groups     ?option=com_users&view=groups  
etc

But it gets messed up because the menu items both in the dropdown and in the sidebar just have the second part eg User Groups
