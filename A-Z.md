#### Abbreviations and acronyms
* The first time you use an abbreviation or acronym explain it in full on each page then refer to it by initials unless it’s well known, eg UK, DVLA, US, EU, VAT, MP etc. 
* If you think your acronym is well known, please provide evidence that 80% of the UK population will understand, and commonly use, the term. Evidence can be from search analytics or testing of a representative sample.
* Don’t use full stops in abbreviations – BBC, not B.B.C.

#### Accents

#### Acronyms

#### Americanisms
* Don’t use Americanisms. You ‘fill in’ a form, not ‘fill out’ a form.
* Exceptions include where it’s part of a specific name, eg ‘4th Mechanized Brigade’.
* Use the ‘ise’ rather than ‘ize’ suffix, eg organise not organize (this isn’t actually an Americanism but is often seen as such).

#### Ampersand
Use ‘and’ rather than an ‘&’, unless it’s a department’s logo image.

#### Brackets
Use (round brackets), not [square brackets]. The only acceptable use of square brackets is for explanatory notes in reported speech, eg a minister’s speech: “Thank you [Foreign Minister] Mr Smith.

#### Bullet points and steps
You can use bullet points to make text easier to read. Make sure that:

* you always use a lead-in line
* the bullets make sense running on from the lead-in line
* you use lower case at the start of the bullet
* you don’t use more than one sentence per bullet point – use commas, dashes or semicolons to expand on an item
* you don’t put ‘or’, ‘and’ after the bullets
* if you add links they appear within the text and not as the whole bullet
* there is no full stop after the last bullet point

Use numbered steps instead of bullet points to guide a user through a process. You don’t need a lead-in line and you can use links and downloads (with appropriate markdown) in steps. Each step ends in a full stop because each step should be a complete sentence.

#### Capitalisation
DON’T USE BLOCK CAPITALS FOR LARGE AMOUNTS OF TEXT AS IT’S QUITE HARD TO READ.

Lower case is preferable but use capitalisation for:
* TODO

#### Contractions
Use contractions eg can’t, you’ll. Avoid using ‘should’ve’, ‘could’ve’, ‘would’ve’ etc – these are hard to read.

#### Dates
* use upper case for months eg January, February
* don’t use a comma between the month and year, eg 14 June 2012
* when space is an issue, eg tables, publication titles etc, you can use truncated months, eg Jan, Feb, Mar, Aug, Sept, Oct, Nov, Dec
* we use ‘to’ in date ranges – not hyphens, en rules or em dashes. For example: tax year 2011 to 2012
* Monday to Friday, 9am to 5pm (put different days on a new line, don’t separate with a comma etc)
* 10 November to 21 December
* don’t use ‘quarter’ for dates; use the months, for example: ‘expenses, Jan to Mar 2013’
* when referring to ‘today’ (eg in a news article) make sure you include the date as well eg ‘The minister announced today (14 June 2012) that…’

#### eg, etc and ie
Don’t use full stops after or between these notations.
User testing has shown that some people are not familiar with abbreviations such as eg, so consider your audience before abbreviating.

#### email
* See Words to Watch

#### etc
* See eg, etc and ie

#### Geography and regions
Use lower case for north, south, east and west, except when they’re part of a name or recognised region.
So, ‘the south-west’ (compass direction), but ‘the South West’ (administrative region).
Use lower case for: the north, the south of England, the south-west, north-east Scotland, south Wales, the west, western Europe, the far east, south-east Asia.
Use upper case for: East End, West End (London), Middle East, Central America, South America, Latin America.

#### Hyphenation
Hyphenate:
* ‘re-’ words starting with ‘e’, eg re-evaluate
* co-ordinate
* co-operate

Don’t hyphenate:
* reuse
* reinvent
* reorder
* reopen
* email

If in doubt, don’t use a hyphen

#### ie
* See eg, etc and ie

#### internet - Lower case.
See Words to Watch

#### Italics
Don’t use italics. Use ‘single quotation marks’ if referring to a document, scheme or initiative.

#### Links
Front-load your link text with the relevant terms and make them active and specific. 
* TODO examples
#### Lists
See bullets and steps

#### Maths 
* Use a minus sign for negative numbers: –6
* Ratios have no space either side of the colon: 5:12
* One space each side of symbols: +, –, ×, ÷ and = (eg 2 + 2 = 4)
* Use the minus sign for subtraction not the dash. 
* Use the correct symbol for the multiplication sign (×), not the letter x. (&times; or &#215;) 

#### Measurements (w or W, h or H, px or PX)
* TODO

#### Money
* Use the £ symbol – £75.
* Don’t use decimals unless pence are included, for example use: £75.50 but not £75.00.
* Don’t use ‘£0.xx million’ for amounts less than £1 million.
* Write out ‘pence’ in full eg ‘calls will cost 4 pence per minute from a landline’.
* Currencies are lowercase.

#### Multilingual
* See Words to Watch

#### Nouns

#### Numbers
Use ‘one’ unless you’re talking about a step, a point in a list or another situation where using the numeral makes more sense. For example like this, ‘in point 1 of the design instructions’, or this:

You’ll be shown 14 clips that feature everyday road scenes.

There will be:

1 developing hazard in 13 clips
2 developing hazards in the other clip
Write all other numbers in numerals (including 2 to 9) except where it’s part of a common expression and it would look strange, eg ‘one or two of them’. Use common sense.

If a number starts a sentence, write it out in full (‘Thirty-four hula-hoops found in researcher’s filing cupboard’) except where it starts a title or subheading.

For numerals over 999 – insert a comma for clarity. ‘It was over 9,000’. Spell out common fractions, such as one-half, but use a % sign for percentages, eg 50%.

Use ‘500 to 900’ and not ‘500–900’ (except in tables).

Use MB not KB for anything over 1MB, eg 4MB not 4096KB . For under 1MB, use KB, eg 569KB not 0.55MB.

Keep it as accurate as possible and up to 2 decimal places. For example: 4.03MB.

Addresses: use ‘to’ in address ranges, for example: 49 to 53 Cherry Street.

#### online - One word.
See Words to Watch

#### ordinal numbers
Spell out first to ninth. After that use 10th etc. 
In tables, use numerals throughout.

#### Oxford (or serial) comma.

#### Punctuation

#### Quotes and speech marks
In long passages of speech, open quotes for every new paragraph, but close quotes only at the end of the final paragraph.

##### Single quotes
Use single quotes:
* in headlines
* for unusual terms
* when referring to words or publications, for example: ‘Download the publication ‘Understanding Capital Gains Tax’ (PDF, 360KB)’

##### Double quotes
Use double quotes in body text for direct quotations.

##### Block quotes
Use the block quote markdown for quotes longer than a few sentences.

#### Seasons
spring, summer, autumn, winter are lowercase. 
Try to avoid using them as they are not global.
See Words to Watch

#### Sentence length
Don’t use long sentences – check any sentences with more than 25 words to see if you can split them to make them clearer.

#### Spaces
Use only one space after a full stop, not 2.

#### Times
* use ‘to’ in time ranges – not hyphens, en rules or em dashes, eg 10am to 11am (not 10–11am)
* 5:30pm (not 1730hrs)
* midnight, not 00:00
* midday, not 12 noon, noon or 12pm

#### Titles
Titles should:
* be 65 characters
* be unique, clear and descriptive
* be front-loaded and optimised for search
* use a colon to break up longer titles
* not contain dashes or slashes
* not have a full stop at the end
* not use acronyms unless they are well-known eg EU

#### Tooltips
Tooltips should:
* be 140 characters or less
* end with a full stop
* not repeat the title or body text
* be clear and specific

#### Trademarked Name
This should always be written with a capital letter unless the trademark is for lowercase.

#### Twitter (trademarked name)
See Words to Watch

#### voice

#### wi-fi (Lower case and hyphenated.)
See Words to Watch

#### Word document (Upper case, because it’s a brand name.)
See Words to Watch
