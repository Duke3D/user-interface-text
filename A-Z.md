#### 'a' or 'an' before H?
* Use 'an' before a silent H: an heir, an hour
* Use 'a' before an aspirated H: a hero, a hotel, a historian
* With abbreviations, be guided by pronunciation: eg an HTML document

#### Abbreviations and acronyms
* The first time you use an abbreviation or acronym explain it in full on each page then refer to it by initials unless it's well known, eg HTML, CSS etc. 
* If you think your acronym is well known, please provide evidence that 80% of the UK population will understand, and commonly use, the term. Evidence can be from search analytics or testing of a representative sample.
* Don't use full stops in abbreviations – BBC, not B.B.C.
* Use all capitals if an abbreviation is pronounced as the individual letters (an initialism): HTML, CSS 
* If it is an acronym (pronounced as a word) spell out with initial capital, eg Nasa, Nato, Unicef, unless it can be considered to have entered the language as an everyday word, such as laser and sim card. 
* Note that pdf is lowercase.

#### Accents
* Use on French, German, Portuguese, Spanish and Irish Gaelic words (but not anglicised French words such as cafe, apart from exposé, lamé, résumé, roué).

#### Americanisms
* Don't use Americanisms. You 'fill in' a form, not 'fill out' a form.
* Exceptions include where it's part of a specific name, eg '4th Mechanized Brigade'.
* Use the 'ise' rather than 'ize' suffix, eg organise not organize (this isn't actually an Americanism but is often seen as such).


#### Contractions
Use contractions eg can't, you'll. Avoid using should've', could've, would've etc – these are hard to read.

#### Dates
* use upper case for months eg January, February
* don't use a comma between the month and year, eg 14 June 2012
* when space is an issue, eg tables, publication titles etc, you can use truncated months, eg Jan, Feb, Mar
* use 'to' in date ranges – not hyphens, en rules or em dashes. For example: copyright year 2011 to 2012
* Monday to Friday, 9am to 5pm (put different days on a new line, don't separate with a comma etc)
* 10 November to 21 December
* don't use 'quarter' for dates; use the months, for example: 'expenses, Jan to Mar 2013'
* when referring to 'today' (eg in a news article) make sure you include the date as well eg 'The minister announced today (14 June 2012) that…'


#### Geography and regions
Use lower case for north, south, east and west, except when they're part of a name or recognised region. So, 'the south-west' (compass direction), but 'the South West' (administrative region).  
Use lower case for: the north, the south of England, the south-west, north-east Scotland, south Wales, the west, western Europe, the far east, south-east Asia.  
Use upper case for: East End, West End (London), Middle East, Central America, South America, Latin America.



#### Maths 
* Use a minus sign for negative numbers with no space: –6
* Ratios have no space either side of the colon: 5:12
* One space each side of symbols: +, –, ×, ÷ and = (eg 2 + 2 = 4)
* Use the minus sign for subtraction not the dash. 
* Use the correct symbol for the multiplication sign (×), not the letter x. (&times; or &#215;) 

#### Measurements 
* Use lower case for all measurements eg px, em, w and h
* Use the metric system for mass and non-web measurements eg kg, cm and m 
* Use celcius for temperature eg 34c
* For all other measurements use SI

#### Money
* Use the £ symbol with no space: – £75.
* Don't use decimals unless pence are included, for example use: £75.50 but not £75.00.
* Don't use '£0.xx million' for amounts less than £1 million.
* Write out 'pence' in full eg 'calls will cost 4 pence per minute from a landline'.
* Currencies are lowercase.

#### Numbers
Use 'one' unless you're talking about a step, a point in a list or another situation where using the numeral makes more sense.   
For example 
* In point 1 of the design instructions.
* You'll be shown 14 clips that feature everyday road scenes.  

* Write all other numbers in numerals (including 2 to 9) except where it's part of a common expression and it would look strange, eg 'one or two of them'. Use common sense.  
* If a number starts a sentence, write it out in full ('Thirty-four images on the page') except where it starts a title or subheading.  
* For numerals over 999 – insert a comma for clarity. 'It was over 9,000'.  
* Spell out common fractions, such as one-half, but use a % sign for percentages with no space, eg 50%.  
* Use '500 to 900' and not '500–900' (except in tables).  
* Use MB not KB for anything over 1MB, eg 4MB not 4096KB . For under 1MB, use KB, eg 569KB not 0.55MB.  
* If necessary keep it as accurate as possible and up to 2 decimal places. For example: 4.03MB.  
* Addresses: use 'to' in address ranges, for example: 49 to 53 Cherry Street.

#### Ordinal Numbers
Spell out first to ninth. After that use 10th etc. 
In tables, use numerals throughout.

#### Seasons
Try to avoid using them as they are not global. spring, summer, autumn, winter are lowercase. 

#### Sentence length
Don't use long sentences – check any sentences with more than 25 words to see if you can split them to make them clearer.

#### Times
* use 'to' in time ranges – not hyphens, en rules or em dashes, eg 10am to 11am (not 10–11am)
* 5:30pm (not 1730hrs)
* midnight, not 00:00
* midday, not 12 noon, noon or 12pm

#### Titles
Titles should:
* should be no longer than 65 characters  
* be unique, clear and descriptive
* be front-loaded and optimised for search
* use a colon to break up longer titles
* not contain dashes or slashes
* not have a full stop at the end
* not use acronyms unless they are well-known eg HTML

#### Tooltips
Tooltips should:
* be as short as possible
* end with a full stop
* not repeat the title or body text
* be clear and specific

#### Trademarked Name
This should always be written with a capital letter unless the trademark is for lowercase eg iPhone.
