#### Abbreviations and acronyms
* The first time you use an abbreviation or acronym explain it in full on each page unless it’s well known, eg UK, DVLA, US, EU, VAT, MP etc. This includes government departments or schemes. Then refer to it by initials, and use acronym Markdown so the full explanation is available as hover text.
* If you think your acronym is well known, please provide evidence that 80% of the UK population will understand, and commonly use, the term. Evidence can be from search analytics or testing of a representative sample.
* Don’t use full stops in abbreviations – BBC, not B.B.C.

#### Accents

#### Acronyms

#### Americanisms
* Don’t use Americanisms. You ‘fill in’ a form, not ‘fill out’ a form.
* Exceptions include where it’s part of a specific name, eg ‘4th Mechanized Brigade’.
* Use the ‘ise’ rather than ‘ize’ suffix, eg organise not organize (this isn’t actually an Americanism but is often seen as such).

#### Ampersand
Use ‘and’ rather than an ‘&’, unless it’s a department’s logo image.

#### Brackets
Use (round brackets), not [square brackets]. The only acceptable use of square brackets is for explanatory notes in reported speech, eg a minister’s speech: “Thank you [Foreign Minister] Mr Smith.

#### Bullet points and steps
You can use bullet points to make text easier to read. Make sure that:

* you always use a lead-in line
* the bullets make sense running on from the lead-in line
* you use lower case at the start of the bullet
* you don’t use more than one sentence per bullet point – use commas, dashes or semicolons to expand on an item
* you don’t put ‘or’, ‘and’ after the bullets
* if you add links they appear within the text and not as the whole bullet
* there is no full stop after the last bullet point

Use numbered steps instead of bullet points to guide a user through a process. You don’t need a lead-in line and you can use links and downloads (with appropriate markdown) in steps. Each step ends in a full stop because each step should be a complete sentence.

#### Capitalisation
DON’T USE BLOCK CAPITALS FOR LARGE AMOUNTS OF TEXT AS IT’S QUITE HARD TO READ.

Lower case is preferable but use capitalisation for:
* TODO

#### Contractions
Use contractions eg can’t, you’ll. Avoid using ‘should’ve’, ‘could’ve’, ‘would’ve’ etc – these are hard to read.

#### Dates
* use upper case for months eg January, February
* don’t use a comma between the month and year, eg 14 June 2012
* when space is an issue, eg tables, publication titles etc, you can use truncated months, eg Jan, Feb, Mar, Aug, Sept, Oct, Nov, Dec
* we use ‘to’ in date ranges – not hyphens, en rules or em dashes. For example:
tax year 2011 to 2012
* Monday to Friday, 9am to 5pm (put different days on a new line, don’t separate with a comma etc)
* 10 November to 21 December
* don’t use ‘quarter’ for dates; use the months, for example: ‘[dept] expenses, Jan to Mar 2013’
* when referring to ‘today’ (eg in a news article) make sure you include the date as well eg ‘The minister announced today (14 June 2012) that…’

#### eg, etc and ie
Don’t use full stops after or between these notations.
User testing has shown that some people are not familiar with abbreviations such as eg, so consider your audience before abbreviating.

#### email
* See Words to Watch

#### etc
* See eg, etc and ie

#### Geography and regions
Use lower case for north, south, east and west, except when they’re part of a name or recognised region.
So, ‘the south-west’ (compass direction), but ‘the South West’ (administrative region).
Use lower case for: the north, the south of England, the south-west, north-east Scotland, south Wales, the west, western Europe, the far east, south-east Asia.
Use upper case for: East End, West End (London), Middle East, Central America, South America, Latin America.

#### hyphenation
Hyphenate:
* ‘re-’ words starting with ‘e’, eg re-evaluate
* co-ordinate
* co-operate

Don’t hyphenate:
* reuse
* reinvent
* reorder
* reopen
* email

If in doubt, don’t use a hyphen
