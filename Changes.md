## These are proposed changes to current behaviour 

Need to get my head around this. It looks like we have the two items below IF we have sub-menus eg Article Manager, Article Manager: Article, Article Manager:Categories  
But it's not consistent 

### Manager
Sometimes we use the word Manager and sometimes we don't. As with everything we must be consistent.   
**Proposal to remove the word Manager from Joomla!**

### Colon
Sometimes we use the colon eg  Article Manager: Articles
Sometimes we don't eg Article Manager Options
