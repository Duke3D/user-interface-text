## Proper Use of the Joomla! name
Joomla! is our name, and as such it deserves everyone's best efforts to protect it.  It defines our brand for both our software and our community.  It sigifies our reputation for excellence.  Here are some guidelines for when and how to properly use our trademark.

#### "Joomla!" should always be capitalised ... ALWAYS
It is our project's name and as such it is a proper name.  Just like you would always capitalise a person's name, please always capitalise Joomla.

#### Joomla! is a trademark, and therefore is an adjective, not a noun.
The name Joomla has come to signify both our software and our wonderful community, which means it has acquired the status of being a trademark.  For a trademark to remain a trademark, it must not be used as a noun, replacing the noun that it is describing.  Doing so transforms a trademark into a generic word and makes it unprotectable.  Examples are aspirin and escalator. At one time these were strong brand names that signified a specific manufacturer, but now they are dictionary terms that anyone may use.  
* Wrong:  "You need to update your Joomla." or "Your Joomla is out of date."
* Right:  "It's time to update your Joomla CMS." or "Install this plugin into your Joomla website."

#### When to bang your Joomla "!"
Our full proper name since 2005 and our registered trademark is "Joomla!" including the exclamation point.  (The exclamation point is sometimes also called a "bang" from both editorial and comic book usage.)  The most proper and complete use of the name is with the exclamation point.  But, there are many circumstances where including punctuation that also signifies the end of a sentence makes a passage of text difficult to read or confusing.  Also, punctuation is not allowed in certain contexts such as aliases and URL's.  To clarify when to use the exclamation point, here is a hierarchy of rules.

##### Rule: 
Use the complete trademark, including the exclamation point (!), whenever possible, and especially with the first predominant use of the mark on any page.

##### Exceptions to this Rule:
The trademark is being used in the middle of a sentence that is not a heading.  It simply improves readability to omit the exclamation point.

The trademark is being used in a URL, menu item, page alias or other situation where including punctuation is impractical.

The exclamation point would appear next to other punctuation.  
* Wrong:  "How will this affect Joomla!?" 
* Better:  "How will this affect Joomla?"  (But note that this is using our trademark as a noun.)
* Best:  "How will this affect the Joomla community?" 

##### Exception to the Exceptions:
Whenever the Joomla name is nested inside another multi-word Joomla-related trademark or service mark.  Joomla has numerous trademarks and service marks beyond the Joomla name standing alone.  In these cases, the exclamation point should be used with no exceptions, even when they appear in the middle of a sentence.  For examples, see "Other Joomla Trademarks," below.

#### When to include Trademark Incidia (<sup>&reg;</sup> or &trade;) 
Part of protecting a trademark, whether registered or not, is giving notice to viewers that we consider the mark to be our property.  As such, with the first predominant use of each Joomla-related trademark or service mark on a Joomla-related page, trademark indicia should be used to signify that we consider the mark to be a protectable trademark.  

The choice of which indicia to use depends on whether the whole mark being protected has been registered as a trademark.  
Open Source Matters, Inc. as the legal owner has registered both the Joomla! wordmark and the Joomla! signature (including the four-J design) as a registered trademark in the United States<sup>1</sup>, the European Community, and many other countries.  Nearly all of the other Joomla-related trademarks are not registered.  Whenever the Joomla! trademark is being used alone, the indicia to use with it is the circle-R (<sup>&reg;</sup>).  Whenever the Joomla! trademark is being nested within another Joomla-related trademark or service mark, the proper indicia to use is the TM indicia (&trade;) at the end of the entire mark.  We request that the appropriate indicia be included at least once on a page, along with a footer that explains that the mark is [registered and] owned by Open Source Matters, Inc.

Including the name Joomla! as a menu item, where the name and logo are at the same size as other menu links, is not considering to be a predominant use so there is no need to add the circle-R to "Joomla!" when it appears as a menu item linking to the home page. This also applies to the Joomla brandmark being used as an icon where it appears among several brandmarks such as the Drupal drop and the WordPress WP.  Only add indicia when Joomla! is appearing as a dominant branding element such as a site logo, in a major heading or title such as in an h1, h2 or h3 tag, or in an illustration that might suggest branding of a page.

#### A brief note about Third-Party Websites.  
The test of whether a use is a trademark use and therefore requires indicia and a disclaimer in the footer is whether a visitor to the site, on a quick first impression, might be confused into thinking they are on an official Joomla-related website because of dominant dominant display and usage of Joomla trademarks.  More information about third party uses, conditional licenses, and the language to use in footers and disclaimers is available on the Open Source Matters website.

#### Other Joomla! Trademarks (&trade;)
There are a number of other trademarks and service marks associated with The Joomla! Project.  We strive to always use the exclamation point and capitalize the initials when the word Joomla is included as part of a longer proper name for a product or service such as the "Joomla! Community Magazine," the "Joomla! Framework" or product releases like "Joomla! 3.3." In these instances it is helpful to add the superscript <sup>TM</sup> indicia the first time a product or service name appears on a page.

The Circle-R indicia only applies to the use of Joomla! (or Joomla! plus the design) standing alone, outside the context of a more specific product or service name. If Joomla! is part of a longer product or service name such as Joomla! 3.3 or Joomla! Framework or Joomla! Developer Network, then the entire phrase is serving as the proper name for that specific product or service. Therefore, the phrase <em>is</em> a trademark and it should have the TM indicia (&trade;) included with the first dominant use of the mark on a page. These phrases are not registered.  Nevertheless, they are protectable trademarks and service marks because they are in use as trademarks, and so a superscript circle-R should <em>NOT</em> be used with them and instead a superscript TM should be used.

Again, the exclamation point should always be included when Joomla! is part of a longer related trademark.  A generic reference to Joomla as either to the community or the software in general would be without a bang.  Examples: Joomla! 3.3, the Joomla! Framework, the Joomla! Extensions Directory, and The Joomla! Project.  (Notice that "The" is part of the project's trademark and should be capitalised.)

#### HTML Codes
For consistent display across fonts, use the html codes for copyrght and trademark symbols.  Test the font to determine if the indicia needs to be wrapped in a "sup" tag to superscript it.  Some fonts include the symbols full size and some are already superscripted.  For Open Source Sans, the preferred font for project pages, the `<sup>` tag is necessary for positioning the &reg; indicia, but not the &copy; or &trade; indicia.

* &reg; - for a registered trade mark indicia use `&reg;` or more likely `<sup>&reg;</sup>`
* &trade; - for a trademark indicia use `&trade;`
* &copy; - for a copyright indicia use  `&copy;`

<p><sup>1</sup> There are currently two United States trademark registrations:<br>
Registration Number: 3479210<br> for the Joomla! wordmark.
Registration Number: 3479224<br> for the signature consisting of the Joomla! wordmark combined with the design.
