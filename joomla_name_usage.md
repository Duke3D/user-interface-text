Summary notes from discussions with Duke.

#1 Joomla! as a registered Trademark (®) (how to use it)
Joomla! is a registered mark1. As such, with the first predominant use of the mark on a Joomla-related page, it is request that the circle-R (®) indicia be included along with a footer that explains that the mark is registered and owned by OSM. Including the name Joomla! as a menu item, where the name and logo are at the same size as other menu links, is not considering to be a predominant use so there is no need to add the circle-R to "Joomla!" when it appears as a menu item linking to the home page. Only add it when Joomla! is appearing as a site logo or in a major heading or title such as in an h1, h2 or h3 tag.
1 there are two registration:
Serial Number: 77226768 - Reg. Number : 3479224
Serial Number: 77224536 - Reg. Number : 3479210

#2 Other Joomla! trademarks (™)
Circle-R only applies to the use of Joomla! (or Joomla! plus the logo design – see #1) standing alone, outside the context of a more specific product or service name. If Joomla! is part of a longer product or service name such as Joomla! 3.3 or Joomla! Framework or Joomla! Developer Network, then the entire phrase is serving as the proper name for that specific product or service. Therefore the phrase IS is trademark and should have the TM indicia (™) included with the first dominant use of the mark on a page. These phrases are NOT registered even though they ARE trademarks and service marks and so a superscript circle-R should NOT be used and instead a superscript TM should be used.

#3 Do we use the !
following the Yahoo! Approach:
The ! is required in all headings and graphics except when it would be in conflict with other appropriate punctuation.
For example, instead of "are you using Joomla!?" we should use "are you using Joomla? yes I use Joomla!"
Note that in french, a space is required before any use of ! or ? or : and others, but as a mark, it should be used as Joomla! Just like for Yahoo!
Within body text, the ! is optional and even discouraged if it affects readability, unless you are referring to another one of trademarks as a proper name.
For example Joomla! 3.3 or the Joomla! Framework or the Joomla! Extensions Directory.
A generic reference to Joomla as either to the community or the software in general would be without a !
There are a number of other trademarks and service marks associated with The Joomla! Project and it asked to ALWAYS use the bang and capitalize the initials when the word Joomla is part of a proper name for a product or service such as the Joomla! Community Magazine, the Joomla! Framework or the releases like Joomla! 3.3 last month. In these instances it is helpful to add the superscript TM indicia the first time a product or service name appears on a page.

NOTE: We should add few examples for right uses and wrong uses + a table with the TM and Registered TM.
