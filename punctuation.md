#### Ampersand
Use 'and' rather than an '&', unless it's part of a trademark.

#### Apostrophes
Used to indicate a missing letter or letters (can't, we'd) or a possessive (David's book).

#### Brackets
Use (round brackets), not [square brackets]. The only acceptable use of square brackets is for explanatory notes in reported speech, eg a minister's speech: “Thank you [Foreign Minister] Mr Smith.

#### Bullet points (ul) and numbered steps (ol)  
You can use bullet points to make text easier to read. Make sure that:

* you always use an introductory line
* the bullets make sense running on from the lead-in line
* you use lower case at the start of the bullet
* you don't use more than one sentence per bullet point – use commas, dashes or semicolons to expand on an item
* you don't put 'or', 'and' after the bullets
* if you add links they appear within the text and not as the whole bullet
* there is no full stop after the last bullet point

Use numbered steps instead of bullet points to guide a user through a process. You don't need a lead-in line and you can use links and downloads (with appropriate markup) in steps. Each step ends in a full stop because each step should be a complete sentence.

#### eg, etc and ie
Don't use full stops after or between these notations.
User testing has shown that some people are not familiar with abbreviations such as eg, so consider your audience before abbreviating.

#### Ellipsis
An ellipsis is a set of three periods ( . . . ) indicating an omission. Each period should have a single space on either side.  

#### etc
* See eg, etc and ie  

#### Hyphenation
Hyphenate:
* 're-' words only if they start with 'e', eg re-evaluate
* co-ordinate
* co-operate

Don't hyphenate:
* email
* reuse
* reinvent
* reorder
* reopen

If in doubt, don't use a hyphen

#### ie
* See eg, etc and ie

#### Italics
Don't use italics. Use 'single quotation marks' if referring to a document, scheme or initiative.

#### Lists
See bullets and steps  

#### Punctuation
For quotes, single quotes and speech marksuse the character code not the keyboard. Order of precedence is HTML Name, HTML Decimal Code, Unicode Hexadecimal.

##### Oxford (or serial) comma.
We don't use the Oxford comma so the final item in a list before the 'and' does not have a comma

##### Quotes and speech marks
Use `&quot; &#34;  &#x22;` at the beginning and end

##### Single quotes
Use either `&#39; &#x27;` at the beginning and end
Use single quotes:
* in headlines
* for unusual terms
* when referring to words or publications, for example: Download the manual 'Understanding ACL' (PDF, 360KB)'

#### Spaces
Use only one space after a full stop, not 2.
