### Reviewed

Several people have already reviewed the document. Nothing major apart from some expected comments about things that are not important ;)

### Stage One

#### How to Apply these changes

There is no easy way to do this. I have looked at various options and discussed them with Roland and Roberto who both know git far far better than me.

As far as I can tell the only practical way to aplpy these changes to the 300 language files is to do them all at once. Otherwise there will be lots of merge conflicts if I try to do seperate PR for seperate issues as there will bound to be changes on the same lines of code.

#### What I would like to propose is the following

1. PLT review these documents and approve or disapprove each change. If there are any changes you are unsure about then they can be left to a later pull request eg removing the word Manager, usage of the word Joomla

2. I prepare ONE PR with all the approved changes for review and commit

3. If needed I prepare additional PR for any changes you are unsure about.

### Stage Two 
* Look at ways to publish these docs so they can be easily found
* Promote the docs
* Find a way that they can be easily forked and translated AND perhaps even added to if needed in another language
